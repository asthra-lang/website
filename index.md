# Asthra Programming Language

Welcome to Asthra, a modern programming language designed for clarity, performance, and exceptional developer experience.

## What is Asthra?

Asthra is a programming language that combines the best aspects of modern language design with practical considerations for real-world development. Our goal is to create a language that is:

- **Clear and Readable**: Code should be self-documenting and easy to understand
- **High Performance**: Efficient execution without sacrificing developer productivity
- **Developer-Friendly**: Great tooling, helpful error messages, and intuitive syntax
