We're excited to introduce **Asthra**, a new programming language designed with clarity, performance, and developer experience at its core.

## Why Asthra?

In today's rapidly evolving software landscape, developers need tools that are both powerful and intuitive. Asthra was born from the desire to create a language that:

- **Prioritizes Readability**: Code should tell a story that any developer can follow
- **Delivers Performance**: Fast execution without compromising on safety
- **Enhances Productivity**: Great tooling and helpful error messages out of the box

## Key Features

### Clear Syntax

Asthra's syntax is designed to be immediately understandable:

```asthra
fn fibonacci(n: int) -> int {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
}

fn main() {
    let result = fibonacci(10)
    println("Fibonacci(10) = {result}")
}
```

### Memory Safety

Built-in memory safety without garbage collection overhead:

```asthra
fn process_data(data: &[int]) -> Vec<int> {
    let mut results = Vec::new()
    
    for item in data {
        if item > 0 {
            results.push(item * 2)
        }
    }
    
    return results
}
```

### Powerful Type System

Expressive types that catch errors at compile time:

```asthra
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E)
}

fn divide(a: float, b: float) -> Result<float, String> {
    if b == 0.0 {
        return Err("Division by zero")
    }
    return Ok(a / b)
}
```

## What's Next?
